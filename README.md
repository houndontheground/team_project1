    We'll come to an agreement together for each task.
    
c. Who has the ability to create or delete remote branches?

    Everyone should be able to create and delete remote branches, but branches shouldn't be deleted or created without discussing the reasons behind it.

    Before you commit and push
    
e. Is there an external tool that we will use to facilitate communication and planning?
    We're using Discord.
    
f. What happens if a scheduled task or functionality is not completed by a team member?

    If a team member doesn't complete a designated task it will be up to them to take responsibility for the mistake and to understand that they are subject to a bad team review at the end of the project. If a team member cannot follow through on a scheduled task it is their responsibility to bring it up with their team in order to possibly swap jobs to keep productivity moving.

    None currently, but eventually password files and node.js files.
