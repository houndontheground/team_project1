a. What editor and tools will be used?
    
    Primarily, we will be using visual studio and github.

b. Who initiates/facilitates the process for adding a new task or functionality to web application?
    
    We'll come to an agreement together for each task.
    
c. Who has the ability to create or delete remote branches?

    Everyone should be able to create and delete remote branches, but branches shouldn't be deleted or created without discussing the reasons behind it.

d.When should you do a code review?
    Before you commit and push
    
e. Is there an external tool that we will use to facilitate communication and planning?
    We're using Discord.
    
f. What happens if a scheduled task or functionality is not completed by a team member?

    If a team member doesn't complete a designated task it will be up to them to take responsibility for the mistake and to understand that they are subject to a bad team review at the end of the project. If a team member cannot follow through on a scheduled task it is their responsibility to bring it up with their team in order to possibly swap jobs to keep productivity moving.

g. What files do our .gitignore files need to negate?
    None currently, but eventually password files and node.js files.
    
h. What timelines will you give for a particular task to be completed?

    Typically, smaller tasks should be completed between each class session. Bigger tasks should be discussed with the team to establish a reasonable time window to complete the respective material.
    
i. What communication touch points do we need to establish throughout our workflow?

    We should discuss the project during each class session if given the time from the instructor, and once on the weekends.

j. What is our documentation process for the application and workflow process?
    Track changes commited (include messages with each significant update) and mention anything significant in the Discord for posterity.
